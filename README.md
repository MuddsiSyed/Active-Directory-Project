# Active Directory Project
## Objective:
The objective of this project is to build an Active Directory home lab in an AWS EC2 environment, integrating key security tools such as Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team. This setup will provide hands-on experience with understanding and managing a domain environment, learning how to ingest events into Splunk, and generating telemetry data to simulate real-world cyber attacks. The primary goal is to enhance the ability to detect and respond to security incidents by analyzing attack patterns and data streams, ultimately improving future detection capabilities.

## Skills Learned:
- <b> Active Directory Management: </b> Gained experience in setting up and managing an Active Directory environment, including domain controllers, user management, and group policies.
- <b> AWS EC2 Management: </b> Developed proficiency in launching and configuring AWS EC2 instances, networking, and ensuring proper security configurations for cloud-based infrastructure.
- <b> Security Tool Integration: </b> Learned how to configure and integrate security tools like Splunk for event monitoring and analysis, Kali Linux for penetration testing, and Atomic Red Team for simulating attack techniques.
- <b> Event Ingestion & Analysis with Splunk: </b> Developed the ability to ingest security-related logs and telemetry data into Splunk, creating alerts and dashboards to detect malicious activities and anomalies.
- <b> Penetration Testing & Attack Simulation: </b> Gained practical experience in using Kali Linux for vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, and using Atomic Red Team to simulate a variety of cyber attacks.
- <b> Threat Detection & Incident Response: </b> Enhanced skills in threat hunting and incident response by analyzing the data generated by simulated attacks, identifying attack patterns, and preparing actionable insights for security improvement.

## Tools Used:
- <b> AWS EC2: </b> For hosting and managing the virtual environment for Active Directory, Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team.
- <b> Active Directory: </b> To simulate a real-world domain environment for testing, including creating user accounts, group policies, and organizational units.
- <b> Splunk: </b> Used for ingesting and analyzing logs, creating search queries, and visualizing security events for effective monitoring and detection.
- <b> Kali Linux: </b> Deployed for penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, allowing the simulation of attacks against the Active Directory infrastructure.
- <b> Atomic Red Team: </b> Used for simulating known attack techniques and generating telemetry data to help fine-tune detection capabilities within Splunk.

## Steps:
### Launch 2 Windows Server, 1 Ubuntu Server and 1 Kali Linux instance in AWS
- One Windows Server will be our Target-PC
